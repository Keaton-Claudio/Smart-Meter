# Smart-Meter
The project focuses on designing a smart energy meter for residential use that measures energy consumption and displays it in clear graphs using InfluxDB. The aim is to come up with a solution that is both more affordable and safer than many existing products

A key feature is the use of split core transformers. Unlike in traditional systems that require hardwiring and pose installation hazards, these transformers can be simply wrapped around wires. This significantly improves safety and simplifies installation, making it suitable for hobbyist-level users who may not necessarily possess the professional electrical expertise to work with potentially deadly electric systems.

Another noteworthy aspect is the development of a custom PCB using an energy metering IC, the Microchip Technology ATM90E32AS. This specialized PCB is designed around this IC as the brain of the meter, ensuring precise and reliable measurements of energy consumption. The IC not only enhances accuracy but also keeps the product compact, efficient, and low-cost.

The product is specifically designed for U.S single split phase residential power systems; a use-case often overlooked by more complex industrial solutions. By focusing on this gap in the market, the project provides consumers with clear energy usage data, which is essential for making informed decisions about consumption and costs.

A major motivation behind this project is the real-world issue of data unavailability. Whilst every home comes installed with a meter by your energy company, energy usage data isn’t always accessible to you, depending on where you live, leaving many unable to verify if they are being billed correctly by their energy company. This gap in transparency can lead to overcharging or inefficient energy use. By providing accurate, real-time data through graphical displays, the meter allows users to monitor trends, spot inefficiencies, and question any discrepancies in billing.

The process is straightforward and pragmatic. Rather than indulging in the usual hype around “smart” technology, the project sticks to delivering tangible benefits: enhanced safety, ease of installation, and accurate energy usage data. This product is designed to appeal to both tech enthusiasts and everyday consumers whilst being an interesting yet practical smart home solution.
